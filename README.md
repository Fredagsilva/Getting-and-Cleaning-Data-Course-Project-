# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-
Last project of Getting and Cleaning Data Course (Coursera)

This file describes the project made as the final work of Getting and Cleaning Data Course from Coursera.
The work consists in clean, merge and manipulate two data sets according with instruction from the course. 
The data sets were obtained from this site: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

In this repo are the files:

- run_analisys.R <- In this file is the script and the explanation of the code that creates 3 Data sets:
 
 1. Newset: data set with just the columns with means and std deviation from the measures.
 2. Finalset: data with the average means and std deviation of each Subject and Activity.
   
 - README.md <- This file that explains the project.
 - Codebook.md <- A code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations.

The Script with the code and explanation is in this file due the request of the course project:
